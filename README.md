# Dribble Design

This is a dribble design, Developed by React Technology.



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  npx create-react-app spur-fit-frontend
  cd spur-fit-frontend

  
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
  npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  npx tailwindcss init -p

```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```


## Building the Webpage

**1.Create Components:** Break down your layout into components. For a basic page, you might have components like `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer`. 

**2.Develop Components:** Start with static HTML structures in each component and style them using Tailwind CSS.

**3.Add Content:** Populate these components with relevant content. Since assets are not provided, you may use placeholder images or create simple graphics.

## Adding Interactivity and Animations
**1.Choose an Animation Library:** Based on the suggestion, explore libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) or Framer Motion. Let's use GSAP for this example.
```bash
  npm install gsap
```

**2.Implement Animations:** Add basic animations like fading in content, animating elements on scroll, etc. Start simple and gradually add more complexity.

## Version Control and Deployment

**1.Git Repository:** Initialize a git repository and make regular commits with meaningful messages. 
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
**2.GitHub:** Create a repository on GitHub and push your local repository.

**3.Deployment:** Choose a platform like Netlify or Vercel for deployment. Follow their documentation to deploy your React app.

**4.README.md:** Write a comprehensive README.md explaining your project, setup instructions, and any other relevant information.









## Submission

- Submit your GitHub repository link.

- Ensure the live website link is included in your GitHub repository, preferably in the README.md.
